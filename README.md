# Data Collection
Two notebooks trying out data collection as an activity for Data Science elective in DLSU

## Experience
Was really fun overall! Using The Guardian's API was pretty easy with the detailed documentation, but using Bulbapedia was a pain, and would've taken a long time if it weren't for Sir Briane's example notebooks before.
